Week 1 -
I strongly suggest that you work on basic HTML plus JavaScript in week 1. You cannot open a million new .html files. You need to do this all on ONE page, with JavaScript/jQuery.  I think that will challenge you. Work on making new text appear on the page and old text disappearing IN WEEK ONE. Get it to work.
-Meanwhile, write the beginning of all branches of the story (not in JS but in your text editor, as a file).

Week 2 -
Now is the time to work on CSS and responsive design so that you can be sure you have a beautiful result to show. Get everything working for at least three tiers or levels or steps into the game.

Week 3 -
Now you should be able to add some more levels and also write an explanation of the game and how far it goes (so anyone who tries it will not be disappointed if it ends quickly for them). Also, refine and improve the CSS and jQuery.




Week 2:
This week I focused on getting everything working. I set up the game so that it would work all the way to the end. I got 2 storylines fully functioning, telekenisis and conjure. The rest will be done by the end of the week. I had a hard time figuring out how to assign each story an ending, which I solved by assigning buttons id's that correspond with the ending for the last question in the storyline. By next week I will be able to focus on CSS and making the game beautiful.





Week 1:
This week I focused on creating the story for my game and making the text for the came show and hide. I had a problem figuring out how to connect my slidetoggle to a button but figured it out using JS fiddle examples. I still have a lot to do but I feel like I made progress this week and have a better understanding of where to go from here.

You are now a hero entrusted with the safety and well being of the people in your district. No matter the situation, you will be there to help and fight for the people who need you.

Villain: You took a hard turn to the left while you were in school and somehow wound up using your powers for your own benefit. All of the instruction and support in the world couldn’t change the fact that your powers are under your control. It was just too easy to get whatever you wanted without breaking a sweat.

Sidekick: You did well in Super School. Turned in your assignments on time and passed all of your classes. You didn’t quite have what it takes to be a hero but you definitely proved that you a good to the core and can contribute to the city and help heroes keep the public safe.

Dropout: School was never your thing. No matter how much potential and power you had, you never felt like school was the place for you to learn to control and use your powers to the best of your potential. Don’t worry; there are plenty of other outlets for people with your kinds of gifts.

Rogue: You made it through Super School but you don’t always follow the rules. You learned to control your powers and hone your abilities, as much as you learned to resist authority figures and do what you thought needed to be done. You are able to do great good and bad, depending on the day.
