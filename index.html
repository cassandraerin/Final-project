	<h1>Villain</h1>
<p>You took a hard turn to the left while you were in school and somehow wound up using your powers for your own benefit.

	<h1>Rogue</h1>
	<p>You made it through Super School but you don’t always follow the rules. You learned to control your powers and hone your abilities, as much as you learned to resist authority figures and do what you thought needed to be done. You are able to do great good and bad, depending on the day. </p>

	<h1>Dropout</h1>
	<p>School was never your thing. No matter how much potential and power you had, you never felt like school was the place for you to learn to control and use your powers to the best of your potential. Don’t worry; there are plenty of other outlets for people with your kinds of gifts.</p>
</section>

<section id='sidekick' class='all-secs'>
	<h1>Sidekick</h1>
	<p>You did well in Super School. Turned in your assignments on time and passed all of your classes. You didn’t quite have what it takes to be a hero but you definitely proved that you a good to the core and can contribute to the city and help heroes keep the public safe. </p>
